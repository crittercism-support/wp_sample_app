For the past 2 years, Crittercism has been transitioning our client libraries
to use a single set of endpoints across all platforms/client libraries. The new
"unified' endpoints use a single URI, data format, and request/response
semantics (e.g. use of HTTP return codes).

The DataContracts in the "Unified" package serialize into the new data formats
common to all the platforms. "Legacy" DataContracts use the old, fragmented
format with somewhat idiosyncratic behavior on each platform.
